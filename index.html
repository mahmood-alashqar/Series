            Netflix, Inc. is an American over-the-top content platform and production company headquartered in Los
            Gatos, California. Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in Scotts Valley,
            California. The company's primary business is a subscription-based streaming service offering online
            streaming from a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house.[14] In January
            2021, Netflix reached 203.7 million subscribers, including 73 million in the United States.[15][16] It is
            available worldwide except in the following: mainland China (due to local restrictions), Syria, North Korea,
            and Crimea (due to US sanctions). It was reported in 2020 that Netflix's operating income is $1.2
            billion.[17] The company has offices in France, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, Japan, South Korea, and the
            United Kingdom.[18] Netflix is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA), producing and distributing
            content from countries all over the globe.

            Netflix's initial business model included DVD sales and rental by mail, but Hastings abandoned the sales
            about a year after the company's founding to focus on the initial DVD rental business.[14][19] Netflix
            expanded its business in 2007 with the introduction of streaming media while retaining the DVD and Blu-ray
            rental business. The company expanded internationally in 2010 with streaming available in Canada,[20]
            followed by Latin America and the Caribbean. Netflix entered the content-production industry in 2013,
            debuting its first series House of Cards.

            Since 2012, Netflix has taken more of an active role as producer and distributor for both film and
            television series, and to that end, offers a variety of "Netflix Original" content through its online
            library.[21] By January 2016, Netflix services operated in more than 190 countries.[22] Netflix released an
            estimated 126 original series and films in 2016, more than any other network or cable channel.[23] Their
            efforts to produce new content, secure the rights for additional content, and diversify through 190
            countries have resulted in the company racking up billions in debt: $21.9 billion as of September 2017, up
            from $16.8 billion from the previous year.[24] $6.5 billion of this is long-term debt, with the remainder in
            long-term obligations.[25] In October 2018, Netflix announced it would raise another $2 billion in debt to
            help fund new content.[26] On July 10, 2020, Netflix became the largest entertainment/media company by
            market capitalization.[27]
